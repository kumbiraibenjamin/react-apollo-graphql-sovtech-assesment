# Setup

There are two main folders in this project.

1. Apollo Server - /chuck-server
1. React App - /react-spa/chuck-jokes

You will need to have node, npm and yarn installed. Preferably the latest versions.

Run the following commands in order while on the top level folder.

1. `npm run install-modules` - to install required node modules
2. `npm run start-server` - to start the apollo server (The server runs on port 4000, ensure that the port is available)
3. `npm run start-app` - to start the react app (The app will run on port 3000, also ensure that is available)

Enjoy.
